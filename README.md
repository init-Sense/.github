# init.Sense
This is the organization page for init.Sense.
Check out [our interactive application](https://init-sense.github.io/eridanus/) and see what you can find!

### Ok. And you do...?
Mostly games. Although one of the projects is literally a web application. 
We experiment with different ideas and unconventional gameplay elements and all our current projects are public and free.

If you ever find some piece of code useful and want to use it, though, a small credit would make a huge difference!

## What are you working on?
Below are in no particular order the projects that are currently being worked on or have been archived.

### Octant
A work-in-progress game which should engage the player in physics related activities in small environments.

### Phony Game <sub>(to be renamed)</sub>
A visual novel which tries to defy the canonical aspects of visual novels by providing an interactive phone with dynamic content and challenges you to focus on the actual dialogue.

### Apus
Our very first attempt at using Godot in 3D. It is a first person walking simulator where you can snap images from your point of view and place them in the map.

### Eridanus <sub>(to be renamed)</sub>
An interactive website where you can find presentations for our games. Currently it is a prototype, but the idea is for it to grow with our projects.

### NOCLIP
Although the repository isn't still linked to init.Sense, the first project we ever made was in Unity and it was for an university course. The idea for NOCLIP was to have a platformer which would let the player take a sneak peek of the map in different checkpoints and to have it noclip through various obstacles in order to reach the end. You can find it [on itch](https://polimi-game-collective.itch.io/noclip).
